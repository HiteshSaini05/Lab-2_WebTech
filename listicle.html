                            <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted
                                to join my
                                friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the
                                combination of
                                fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda
                                and not so
                                boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in
                                them (or
                                maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop
                                alternative for the
                                times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.
                            <p>
                            </p> <b>Recommendation:</b> Raspberry Italian soda</p>

                            <h4>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</h4>
                            <p>Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of
                                modern age
                                designing with classic old school comfort.
                                The place is divided into three areas basically which is the indoor lounge, the outdoor
                                and
                                rooftop
                                seating.
                                The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to the restaurant where as the
                                outdoor
                                seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and funky wall frames.
                                An ideal place to chill and relax.</p>
                            <p>Coming to the food i got a chance to try a wide spread from the menu.

                            <p>I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because
                                CoHo is the
                                only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know
                                what a
                                Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I
                                ordered on
                                a whim from CoHo was delicious.</p>
